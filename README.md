These are the scribes I made for CS 7840: Foundations and Applications of Information Theory (Fall 2024):
  - scribe1: - includes an observation of change in mutual information by combining variables by using tennies game data and matching it withe the performance of decision tree classifier
  - scribe2: - Occam's razor, Bayes Method, concept of regularization and possible conceptual contradiction. Taking inspiration from Neural Computation(1992) I trained linear regression and ridge regression on an synthetic generated data with high multicollinearity and noise
